# Server Engine

A simple Event Driven TCP Server written in GoLang.

It is not a complete work but a good starting point, I kept in mind to use this kind of code in case I will create a server application or an online game emulator.
It is using a GUID to recognize clients in the server, which has not been made me.

## Setup
First run dependencies.bat or dependencies.sh to install required libraries.

## Compile & Run

To test the server simply run a telnet client and type the path to a file that the server will open and send its content to the client.
To quit the telnet session you case you the ESC button (0x1B).
